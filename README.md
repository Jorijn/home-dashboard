# What's the general purpose of this project?

As a freelance developer, I need to keep my knowledge up-to-par with the current demand on the market. Currently, there is a big shift towards front-end frameworks like AngularJS. Therefor, I came up with the following idea:

* OAuth connections between this application and all my smart home appliances: Nest, NetAtmo, Smappee
* Parsing of gathered trip data from my car - Peugeot 308
* All neatly presented in a AngularJS dashboard, providing basic filtering, graphing and displaying of said data
